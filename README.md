# Swift DataStructure

##### Data Structures of Swift4.
##### These codes are what I was studing about Swift Data Structure(abstract data type).

### 01.[2D Array](https://github.com/TaeJoongYoon/Swift_DataStructure/blob/master/2DArray.playground/Contents.swift)
<hr>

In computer science, an **array** data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.

An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.

The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.

### 02.[Linked List](https://github.com/TaeJoongYoon/Swift_DataStructure/blob/master/LinkedList.playground/Contents.swift)
<hr>

A **linked list** is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes.

Each node contains two fields, called **links**, that are references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes.

The beginning and ending nodes' previous and next links, respectively, point to some kind of terminator, typically a sentinel node or **null**, to facilitate traversal of the list.

If there is only one sentinel node, then the list is circularly linked via the sentinel node.

It can be conceptualized as **two singly linked lists** formed from the same data items, but in opposite sequential orders

</br>

### 03.[Stack](https://github.com/TaeJoongYoon/Swift_DataStructure/blob/master/Stack.playground/Contents.swift)
<hr>

A **stack** is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

- push, which adds an element to the collection, and
- pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, **LIFO (last in, first out)**. 

</br>

### 04.[Queue](https://github.com/TaeJoongYoon/Swift_DataStructure/blob/master/Queue.playground/Contents.swift)
<hr>

A **queue** is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue.

This makes the queue a **FIFO (first in, first out)** data structure.

</br>

### 05.[Deque](https://github.com/TaeJoongYoon/Swift_DataStructure/blob/master/Deque.playground/Contents.swift)
<hr>

A **double-ended queue (abbreviated to deque)** is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the **front (head)** or **back (tail)**.

It is also often called a head-tail linked list, though properly this refers to a specific data structure implementation of a deque

</br>

### 06.[Tree](https://github.com/TaeJoongYoon/Swift_DataStructure/blob/master/Tree.playground/Contents.swift)
<hr>

A **tree** structure or tree diagram is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form.

It is named a **"tree structure"** because the classic representation resembles a tree, even though the chart is generally upside down compared to an actual tree, with the **"root"** at the top and the **"leaves"** at the bottom.


</br>

### 07.[BinaryTree](https://github.com/TaeJoongYoon/Swift_DataStructure/blob/master/BinaryTree.playground/Contents.swift)
<hr>

A **binary tree** is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as **the left child and the right child**.

A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set.

Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well.
